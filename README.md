# Flask-E2E-Testing-Project
A web application built using Flask, with end-to-end (E2E) testing implemented using Selenium and pytest. This project demonstrates the creation of a simple web app and simulates user interactions to ensure that the entire flow from the front-end UI to the backend works as expected.
